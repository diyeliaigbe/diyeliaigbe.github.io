A Security Expert in criminal psychopathy and forensic psychology. I am also a security consultant and analyzer on TV and Radio respectively. I analyze behaviour and psycho-analyze crime to gain better understanding of the criminal's mind. I have expertise in profiling and assessing personality. I also specialize in handwriting analysis - I can assess people by their handwriting - it reflects their emotional stability. 

I am currently a PhD candidate in Sociology at the [University of Calabar](https://www.unical.edu.ng/) under the supervison of [Dr. Agba Ogaboh](https://www.unical.edu.ng/staff/user/profile-agba-ogaboh). My research interests are criminilogy, victimology and handwriting analysis. My PhD thesis is on the "Determinants of Inmates' Rehabilitation in Correctional Centres in Cross-River State, Nigeria".
